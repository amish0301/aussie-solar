Each solar panel consists of silicon solar cells covered by a sheet of glass and held together by a metal frame. When sunlight hits the solar cells, it activates electrons, which then flow through the cell.Wires capture this flow of electrons and combine it with the output of other cells within the panel.Solar panels are classified based on their rated power output in Watts, which indicates the power they can produce in 1 peak sun hour. It's important to note that solar panel output is affected by cell operating temperature. They are an optimum choice to power homes, businesses, and even entire communities.",

                details: "String inverters are commonly used in both residential and commercial solar power systems to manage interconnected chains of solar panels, known as â€œstring circuits. These string circuits consist of solar panels wired together sequentially, and they are linked to the string inverter. It is called a string inverter because it is typically connected to multiple solar panels arranged in strings. These inverters are at the heart of many grid-tied solar power systems, making them an essential component of any solar installation. The inverter includes Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technology, which constantly monitors the electrical characteristics of the solar panels. MPPT ensures that the inverter operates at the optimal voltage and current levels to maximise the power output from the panels.However, they have a drawback: if one panel in a string is obstructed, the entire string's performance decreases due to sensitivity to individual panel issues. And as more homes, businesses, and industries install solar power across the country, this trend is expected to continue.",

                details: "Microinverters are small, router-sized devices installed beneath each solar panel. Unlike string inverters, which connect to multiple panels and limit performance to the weakest link, microinverters are installed directly at each panel, with one microinverter dedicated to each. This means that every solar panel operates independently, maximizing energy production. This is why, they are slightly more expensive than string inverters. They also provide precise monitoring capabilities. While central inverters offer only system-level data, microinverters enable you to track the production of each individual panel. This level of granularity empowers you to identify and address issues promptly. Scalability is another key benefit of microinverters. If you plan to expand your solar system, you can easily add microinverters one at a time, offering flexibility and adaptability to your energy needs.",

They are an ideal choice for you if you are aiming to install a solar power system with future upgrade potential, including battery storage.These inverters come with several key features: they can intelligently manage power from solar panels, solar batteries, and the utility grid simultaneously, and they can convert energy between AC and DC interchangeably, opening up new possibilities for energy storage. They excel in areas with unreliable grids, providing a stable power supply. They also enable the storage of excess solar energy in batteries for later use. Additionally, they offer reliable backup power during blackouts.",
